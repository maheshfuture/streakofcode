The first and the only line of input contains 4 space separated integers d1, s1, d2, s2

2<=d1,d2 <=1000
2<= s1,s2 <=1000
Output
The output contains the average speed of Ram for the whole race rounded up to 2 decimal places.
Example
Sample Input
10 5 20 4

Sample Output
4.29

Explanation
Time = Distance / Speed

Time taken while running = 10 / 5 = 2
Time taken while cycling = 20 / 4 = 5

Total Distance = 30KM
Total Time = 7 Hours

Average Speed = 30 / 7
= 4.29


#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>  

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int d1, s1, d2, s2;
    cin >> d1 >> s1 >> d2 >> s2;

    double time_running = static_cast<double>(d1) / s1;
    double time_cycling = static_cast<double>(d2) / s2;

    double total_distance = d1 + d2;
    double total_time = time_running + time_cycling;

    double average_speed = total_distance / total_time;

    cout << fixed << setprecision(2) << average_speed << endl;

    return 0;
}

Story Points
Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
Himanshu, Gorakh, Vikas, and Hritvik are competing to collect the highest number of story points for the week. Ram, an expert, has created a 2-D array representing the story points for each person from Monday to Friday. The array has dimensions 4x5, with each row corresponding to Himanshu, Gorakh, Vikas, and Hritvik, and each column representing the story points for a specific day.

Your task is to determine the person who accumulates the maximum story points throughout the entire week. Compare the total story points earned by each person and identify the one with the highest count.

Write a program that takes the 2-D array as input and outputs the name of the person who obtains the maximum story points for the week.
Input
Input consists of a 2-D array of size 4*5
There are 4 lines and each line consists of 5 integers separated by space representing the story points for each day of the week.

1<= Story Points <= 20
Output
Print the name of the person with the highest story points for the week.

Note
2 persons cannot have the same count of story points for a week.
Example
Sample Input
4 5 2 7 6
1 2 3 4 5
8 7 6 4 2
1 4 9 7 8

Sample Output
Hritvik

Explanation
Himanshu - 4 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 24
Gorakh - 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
Vikas - 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 27
Hritvik - 1 + 4 + 9 + 7 + 8 = 29

Hritvik has highest story points

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> story_points(4, vector<int>(5));
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j) {
            cin >> story_points[i][j];
        }
    }

    vector<int> total_points(4, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j) {
            total_points[i] += story_points[i][j];
        }
    }

    int max_points = total_points[0];
    string person = "Himanshu";
    for (int i = 1; i < 4; ++i) {
        if (total_points[i] > max_points) {
            max_points = total_points[i];
            if (i == 1) {
                person = "Gorakh";
            } else if (i == 2) {
                person = "Vikas";
            } else if (i == 3) {
                person = "Hritvik";
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

Vikas and his string
Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
Vikas is quite stressed by the inconsistent use of uppercase and lowercase letters in words within his team. To address this, he is creating a browser extension that transforms the letter case of each word.
The goal is to ensure that each word is either entirely in lowercase or entirely in uppercase, with minimal conversions, if number of lowercase letters are equal to uppercase convert the string in uppercase. Your task is to write a program that accomplishes this task for a given input string.
Input
The first and the only line of the input represents a string.

Constraints
1<=length of string<=106,/sup>
Input string will only consists of lowercase or uppercase english letters
Output
Output contains the string converted in uppercase or lowercase.
Example
Sample Input
StriKe

Sample Output, /b>
strike

#include <bits/stdc++.h> // header file includes every Standard library
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string s;
    cin>>s;
    int upper = 0, lower = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
    {
        if (s[i] >= 'A' && s[i] <= 'Z')
            upper++;
        else if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z')
            lower++;
    }
    if(lower>upper){
    transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);
    cout<<s<<endl;
    }else{
        transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::toupper);
        cout<<s<<endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Different characters
Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
You are given two strings a and b. Your task is to find the number of indices where string a differs from string b. (Note: Strings are case insensitive i. e. Hello is same as hELLo).
Input
The input consists of two lines:

The first line contains string a (1 <= |a| <= 10^4), representing the first string.
The second line contains string b (|b| = |a|), representing the second string.
Output
Print an integer, the count of places where the two strings differ.
Example
Input
a = "NewtonSchool"
b = "newrOnTshool"

Output
3

Explanation
The strings differ at index 3, 6 and 7. Hence the output is 3.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string a, b;
    cin>>a>>b;

    transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), ::tolower);
    transform(b.begin(), b.end(), b.begin(), ::tolower);

    int count = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < a.length(); ++i) {
        if (a[i] != b[i]) {
            ++count;
        }
    }

    cout <<count << endl;

    return 0;
}

Difference between nums
Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
Given three integers (num1, num2, num3), you need to determine whether one of the numbers is the difference between the other two numbers. If such a number exists, return "Yes". Otherwise, return "No". (Note: Output is case sensitive).
Input
The only line of the input contains three space separated integers representing num1, num2 and num3.

Constraints
-10^9 ≤ num1 ≤ 10^9
-10^9 ≤ num2 ≤ 10^9
-10^9 ≤ num3 ≤ 10^9
Output
Print "Yes" if one of the numbers is the difference between the other two numbers, otherwise return "No".
Example
Input:
15 7 8

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
Since the difference between 15 and 7 is 8, which is the third number.
So the answer is "Yes".

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2, num3;
    cin >> num1 >> num2 >> num3;

    if (num1 == num2 + num3 || num2 == num1 + num3 || num3 == num1 + num2) {
        cout << "Yes" << endl;
    } else if (num1 == abs(num2 - num3) || num2 == abs(num1 - num3) || num3 == abs(num1 - num2)) {
        cout << "Yes" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Total gift pairs
Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
In a gift store, you have won a coupon with a coupon number. This coupon can be used to purchase pairs of gifts, and it provides a discount on pairs of gifts whose sum is a multiple of the coupon number. You are given a list of n gifts with their respective costs. Your task is to find the total number of pairs of gifts that you can purchase using the coupon to get a discount.
Input
The first line contains an integer n representing the size of gifts list.
The second line contains a list of n positive integers representing the cost of each gift
The third line contains a single integer representing the coupon number.


Constraints
1 <= n <= 106
1 ≤ gifts[i] ≤ 105
1 ≤ coupon_number ≤ 105
Output
Print an integer representing the total number of pairs of gifts that can be purchased using the coupon to get a discount.
Example
Input:
5
5 7 9 10 15
5


Output:
3

Explanation:
In the example, the pairs of gifts with sums divisible by 5 are:
(5, 10)
(5, 15)
(10, 15)

So, the total number of such pairs is 3.

#include <iostream>

        remainderFrequency[remainder]++;
    }

    int countPairs = 0;

    for (const auto& pair : remainderFrequency) {
        int remainder = pair.first;
        int frequency = pair.second;

        if (remainder == 0 || 2 * remainder == couponNumber) {
            countPairs += frequency * (frequency - 1) / 2;
        } else if (remainderFrequency.count(couponNumber - remainder) > 0) {
            // Pairs where gifts have complementary remainders
            countPairs += frequency * remainderFrequency[couponNumber - remainder];
            remainderFrequency[remainder] = 0; // Mark remainder as used
            remainderFrequency[couponNumber - remainder] = 0; // Mark complementary remainder as used
        }
    }

    cout << countPairs << endl;

    return 0;
