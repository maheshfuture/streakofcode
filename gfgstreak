Given an array A of size N. Find the maximum subset-sum of elements that you can make from the given array such that for every two consecutive elements in the array, at least one of the elements is present in our subset. 

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 4
A[] = {1, -1, 3, 4}
Output: 8
Explanation: 
We can choose 0th,2nd & 3rd index(0 based 
Index),so that it can satisfy the 
condition & can make maximum sum 8. 
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
A[] =  {0, 2, 0};
Output: 2
Explanation: 
We can choose 1st index. Here the 
maximum possible sum is 2.
Your task:

You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaxSubsetSum() which takes the array A and its size N as input and returns the Maximum possible subset-sum.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Solution:-
class Solution {

  public:
    long long findMaxSubsetSum(int N, vector<int> &A) {
        // code here
        long long a = A[0],b = A[1] + max(0,A[0]);
        for(long long c,i=2;i<N;i++)
            c = max(a,b) + A[i],a = b,b = c;
        return max(a,b);
    }
};

Count Total Setbits
You are given a number N. Find the total number of setbits in the numbers from 1 to N. 

Example 1:

Input: N = 3
Output: 4
Explaination: 
1 -> 01, 2 -> 10 and 3 -> 11. 
So total 4 setbits.
Example 2:

Input: N = 4
Output: 5
Explaination: 1 -> 01, 2 -> 10, 3 -> 11 
and 4 -> 100. So total 5 setbits.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countBits() which takes N as input parameter and returns the total number of setbits upto N.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
solution:-
class Solution {
  public:
    long long countBits(long long N) {
        // code here
       int ans=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
            ans+=__builtin_popcount(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

Find triplets with zero sum
Given an array arr[] of n integers. Check whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero. 

Note: Return 1, if there is at least one triplet following the condition else return 0.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0, -1 and 1 forms a triplet
with sum equal to 0.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: No triplet with zero sum exists. 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the boolean function findTriplets() which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array (n) as inputs and print 1 if the function returns true else print 0 if the function returns false. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constrains:
1 <= n <= 104
-106 <= Ai <= 106
solution--

class Solution{
  public:
    //Function to find triplets with zero sum.
    bool findTriplets(int arr[], int n)
    { 
        //Your code here
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int a=arr[i];
            int low= i+1;
            int high=n-1;
            while(low<high){
                if(arr[low]+arr[high]+a == 0){
                    return 1;
                }
                else if(arr[low]+arr[high] < -a){
                    low++;
                }
                else{
                    high--;
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
