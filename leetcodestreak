Maximize Score After N Operations

You are given nums, an array of positive integers of size 2 * n. You must perform n operations on this array.

In the ith operation (1-indexed), you will:

Choose two elements, x and y.
Receive a score of i * gcd(x, y).
Remove x and y from nums.
Return the maximum score you can receive after performing n operations.

The function gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 * gcd(1, 2)) = 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,6,8]
Output: 11
Explanation: The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 * gcd(3, 6)) + (2 * gcd(4, 8)) = 3 + 8 = 11
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 14
Explanation: The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 * gcd(1, 5)) + (2 * gcd(2, 4)) + (3 * gcd(3, 6)) = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14

1 <= n <= 7

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5

2551. Put Marbles in Bags

Add to List

You have k bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight of the ith marble. You are also given the integer k.

Divide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules:

No bag is empty.
If the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag.
If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].
The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.

 

Example 1:

Input: weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. 
The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. 
Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: weights = [1, 3], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. 
Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= weights.length <= 105
1 <= weights[i] <= 109
//greedy algorithm 
class Solution {
public:
    long long putMarbles(vector<int>& weights, int k) {

            arr[i]=weights[i]+weights[i+1];
        }
        sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
        long long ans=0;
        k--;
        n--;
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
            ans-=arr[i];
            ans+=arr[n-i-1];
        }
        return ans;

2272. Substring With Largest Variance
The variance of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.

Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the largest variance possible among all substrings of s.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aababbb"
Output: 3
Explanation:
All possible variances along with their respective substrings are listed below:
- Variance 0 for substrings "a", "aa", "ab", "abab", "aababb", "ba", "b", "bb", and "bbb".
- Variance 1 for substrings "aab", "aba", "abb", "aabab", "ababb", "aababbb", and "bab".
- Variance 2 for substrings "aaba", "ababbb", "abbb", and "babb".
- Variance 3 for substring "babbb".
Since the largest possible variance is 3, we return it.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde"
Output: 0
Explanation:
No letter occurs more than once in s, so the variance of every substring is 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of lowercase English letters.

solution--
class Solution {
public:
    int largestVariance(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26,0);
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
            freq[s[i]-'a']++;
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<26;j++){
                if(i==j || freq[i]==0 || freq[j]==0) continue;
                int c1=0,c2=0,rmc=freq[j];
                for(auto ch: s){
                    if(ch=='a'+i) c1++;
                    if(ch=='a'+j){
                        c2++;
                        rmc--;
                    }
                    if(c2>0) ans=max(ans,c1-c2);

111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

solution--by using recursion solution of dfs--
class Solution {
public:
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==NULL) return 0;
        if(root->left==NULL || root->right== NULL) return 1+minDepth(root->right)+minDepth(root->left);
        else return (1+min(minDepth(root->left),minDepth(root->right)));
    }

802. Find Eventual Safe States
There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

 

Example 1:

Illustration of graph
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.
Example 2:

Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<int>adj[n];
        vector<int>indegree(n,0);

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(auto it:graph[i]){
                adj[it].push_back(i);
                indegree[i]++;
            }
        }
        queue<int>q;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(indegree[i]==0){
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        vector<int>safeNodes;
        while(!q.empty()){
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            safeNodes.push_back(node);
            for(auto it:adj[node]){
                indegree[it]--;
                if(indegree[it]==0){
                    q.push(it);
                }
            }
        }

        sort(safeNodes.begin(),safeNodes.end());
        return safeNodes;
    }
};
